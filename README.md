Garbage Route Optimization Systems (GROS), a city-wide network of trash bin sensors that will monitor
the amount of trash in each respective bin in order to assist garbage collection services 
with conservation of resources. GROS accomplishes this through the optimization of trash collection routes 
and tagging the level of trash on each bin to assign priorities to them. This project not only has the potential 
of reducing the carbon footprint generated by garbage trucks,  but also allows for the reduction of work hours 
for the drivers, as well eliminating the presence of toxic trash in neighborhoods to provide American citizens cleaner cities.
